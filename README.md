Project Title: Jewelry Storage Box with Integrated Security System
Overview

This project is focused on creating a jewelry storage box equipped with an innovative security system designed to protect valuable items such as jewelry, money, important documents, gold, and other precious belongings. The system utilizes a combination of laser and ultrasonic technologies to provide robust protection against potential threats, including intrusion or theft attempts.

Note: The code in this project is written with a focus on readability and ease of understanding rather than optimization. While it may not be the most efficient, it is designed to be accessible and clear for anyone reviewing the code.

Project Purpose
In today's world, where valuable items are exposed to various dangers, the need for an effective security system is of utmost importance. This project aims to develop and implement a specialized security system tailored for safeguarding valuable items.

1. Project Objective
The primary goal of the project is to create an integrated security system that ensures reliable protection for valuable items using laser and ultrasonic technologies. The system is designed to be effective, easy to use, and capable of offering a high level of security against different types of threats, such as intrusion or theft.

2. Expected Outcomes
2.1 Development of a Laser System:
The project includes the research, design, and construction of a laser-based system positioned around the valuable items. If the laser beams are interrupted, a sound signal will be generated until the laser beam is no longer blocked, serving as a warning to a potential intruder.

2.2 Implementation of Ultrasonic Sensors:
In addition to the lasers, the system will incorporate ultrasonic sensors placed behind the laser beams. If these sensors detect movement, which could be interpreted as malicious intent, an alarm with a light signal will be triggered to draw attention to the area.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to contribute to creating a more secure environment for storing valuable items and address the growing need for innovative security solutions.

Main Features
What is the Project?
The project, titled "Jewelry Storage Box," is an innovative security system fully integrated into a finely crafted wooden box. The box is made using hand-cut wooden panels, ensuring the structure's strength and stability.

The core of the box houses ultrasonic sensors that detect movement in the surrounding environment. These sensors are strategically positioned to cover the entire area around the valuable item, ensuring that any unauthorized movement triggers the alarm.

In the four pillars of the box, lasers and light sensors are integrated, with all wiring carefully concealed and organized. This approach not only ensures the device's aesthetics and discretion but also simplifies its maintenance and management.

On the "ceiling" of the box, Arduino and Breadboard are mounted, which control the entire system. They are discreetly integrated into the interior of the box to maintain its visual appeal. LED matrices are installed on the bottom of the "ceiling," providing a visual indicator of an activated alarm.

How Does the System Work?
When the light beam from one of the lasers to the receiver is interrupted, the buzzer signals a warning to the potential thief. However, if the intruder decides to cross one of the many ultrasonic sensors in the middle of the box, the alarm is immediately activated. The alarm consists of sound and light signals, providing immediate warning of unauthorized access or danger. With its reliable functionality and intelligent features, the project represents not only an effective security system but also an elegant solution for protecting valuable items.

Components Used
The project utilizes various components, including laser modules, light sensor modules (light receivers), ultrasonic distance sensors, a buzzer, and an 8x8 LED matrix.

I chose the OKY3301 laser modules for my project due to several advantages they offer. First, their exceptionally high accuracy and precision make them ideal for applications requiring precise measurement or positioning, as is the case with my project. Additionally, they are compact, making them easy to integrate into the project's pillars.

Furthermore, I included light sensor modules, known as the TEMT6000 Ambient Light Sensor Module. The selection of these sensors was deliberate, as they are characterized by minimal size and exceptional durability. Their advantages include accuracy and fast response time, making them suitable for my project.

To complement the functionality, I also decided to include HS-RS04 ultrasonic sensors, which are known for their ease of use and high accuracy. Their response time and durability were also factors that influenced my decision.

For audio and visual signaling in my project, I used a buzzer for sound signals and an LED matrix for light signals. These components enhance the functionality of the project and provide greater versatility.

All these components were integrated and connected to an Arduino Mega 2560, allowing me to manage and control them through the microcontroller. This enabled me to successfully create a complex system that meets the requirements and goals of my project.
